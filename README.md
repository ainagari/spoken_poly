# Polysemy in Spoken Conversations üó£Ô∏è and Written Texts üìÑ

This repository contains code for our upcoming paper:

Aina Gar√≠ Soler, Matthieu Labeau and Chlo√© Clavel (2022). Polysemy in Spoken Conversations and Written Texts. To appear in _Proceedings of the 13th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC)_, Marseille, France, June 20-25.


## About the datasets

We cannot directly share the datasets used in the paper nor the annotations derived. However, to test the code, you can download the Senseval and SemEval datasets, which are ready to be used with our code.

You can find the full WSD Evaluation framework (Raganato et al., 2017) [here](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/wsdeval/).

You can use, for example:
* ``Evaluation_Datasets/senseval2/senseval2.gold.key.txt``, containing gold annotations for Senseval2. 
* ``Evaluation_Datasets/senseval2/senseval2.data.xml``, which contains this dataset in xml format. 

Place these two files **under the ``Data/`` directory.**

I plan to add here information on how the other datasets used in the paper were retrieved and turned into xml format before being disambiguated. In the meantime feel free to [contact me](#contact). 

We do include the utterance IDs of the debates which served as monologs. You can find them in `Data/debate_monologue_ids.txt`. The other IDs (only those that correspond to Trump's or Biden's utterances) counted as dialog utterances and were split by topic. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmphilly18/us-presidential-debatefinal-october-2020).


## Automatic WSD

Automatic WSD annotation was performed with the ESCHER model (Barba et al., 2021) with the code available [in their repository](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/esc). 


## Calculating polysemy measures

In this repository you can find a simplified version of the original code which can serve to calculate the 5 polysemy measures described in the paper for a text annotated with senses. See the section above to obtain example input files. Then run:

``read_wsd_predictions.py --dataset_name senseval2-gold --sense_type senses --measure mosd --output_dir outputs/``

More information on the arguments:
* ``--dataset_name``
* ``--include_adverbs`` if indicated, we include adverbs in the polysemy counts. By default, we do not.
* ``--sense_type`` can be ``senses``, ``supersenses`` or ``hypernyms``	
* ``measure`` can be ``mosd``, ``avgsenses``, ``pa`` or ``entropy``. When using ``pa`` (Potential Ambiguity), the output for the measure PCT-POLY is automatically included in the output file.
* ``output_dir`` the name of an existing directory where results will be stored.

To use the code with your own dataset, you should have two files (to be put in ``Data/``):

* A file containing WSD annotations (the output of the WSD model). The filename should be ``{DATASETNAME}_predictions.txt`` (where ``{DATASETNAME}`` is the name to be used for the ``--dataset_name`` argument of ``read_wsd_predictions.py``.
* A file containing the text content in xml format. The filename should be ``{DATASETNAME}.data.xml``.

You will need to modify the function ``load_and_prepare_dataset`` in ``utils.py`` to convert your xml into a pandas DataFrame. Let me know if you need help with that step.
